Noctámbula

Experimental display typeface

This typeface is an experimental display font developed through a visual exploration inspired by The Cruel Prince by Holly Black. It was created as a conceptual project to translate the duality between fantasy and danger into typographic form.

Designed primarily for expressive and display use, the typeface aims to evoke a magical yet unsettling atmosphere, where beauty and threat coexist. Its letterforms embrace contrast and irregularity, reinforcing a sense of tension and narrative depth.
